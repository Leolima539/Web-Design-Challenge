# Web-Design-Challenge

You can test the site here : https://leolima539.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

In the ocassion I decided to follow the instructions to a point but then I decided to experiment with background images and different layouts for the site, I added a title and a subtitle.

This is a website to show the results of the previous analysis WeatherPY.

You will find a homepage that presents the study and then you will find different pages for 4 different analysis that were done to understand how latitude is related to different weather factors like Temperature, wind speed, humidity and cloudiness.

You will also find a comparison page where you can find 4 visualizations of how latittude relates to each of these factors and at last you can find a Data page that shows the data that was used to create this analysis.
